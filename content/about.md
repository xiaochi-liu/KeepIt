Interestingly, after watching the talk, [_Your Public Garden_](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/your-public-garden/), given by Vicki Boykis on rstudio::global 2021, I suddenly got a huge motivation to build my blog website.
Hope it would be a good way to establish a good writing habit and push myself writing, writing, and writing!


Currently, I'm doing my PhD at Macquarie University, Sydney, and my research interest includes Geographical Information Science (GIS), Machine Learning, Spatial Statistics, and the application of those novel-fancy modelling in Environmental and Public Health.

I work mostly in R and RStudio, and really enjoy conducting end-to-end data analyses.
Outside of work, I like playing the piano, hitting gym, and practising Kendo, which I think is a really good way to adjust my mind and get refreshed. 

This blog was powered by the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) R package, the theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
